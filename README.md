# End-to-End-Supply-Chain-Analysis
SQL + Power BI | Inventory Optimization | Supplier Strategy | Retail Performance

# Project Overview:
This project analyzes supply chain performance from supplier sourcing to inventory optimization and store-level demand analytics. The objective is to simulate how a company can use structured data and analytical modeling to:
- Segment suppliers by strategic importance and operational complexity
- Identify profit concentration across vendors and products
- Optimize inventory using EOQ and reorder point calculations
- Monitor lead time variability and supplier reliability
- Evaluate store performance and growth trends
- Measure inventory efficiency using financial and operational metrics

Note: This project is built as a structured, multi-phase analytics portfolio piece and is currently a Work in Progress (WIP).

# Project Goal:
The long-term objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:
- Think across the full supply chain lifecycle
- Translate business problems into structured SQL models
- Connect operational metrics to financial impact
- Communicate insights through executive-level dashboards

# Tools and Technologies Used / To be Used:
- SQL (SQLite): data modeling, aggregation, window functions
- Power BI: dashboard visualization & KPI reporting
- Relational database design (foreign keys, normalization)
- Quantitative inventory formulas (EOQ, ROP, GMROI)
